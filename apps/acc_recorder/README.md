# Recorder

![icon](app.png)

This app allows you to record data every few seconds - it can run in background.

It can write the data in the same time to the smartphone via Gadgetbridge.

Usually you'd record acceleration (but this is not required). The data can later be exported as CSV via the Download button in the Bangle.js App Store entry for Recorder.

## Usage

First run the `Recorder` app, here you can configure what you want to record, how often,
and you can start and stop recordings.
