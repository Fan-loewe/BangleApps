# Recorder

![icon](app.png)

This app allows you to record data every few seconds - it can run in background.

Usually you'd record GPS (but this is not required). The data can later be exported as CSV, KML or GPX files via the Download button in the Bangle.js App Store entry for Recorder.

## Usage

First run the `Recorder` app, here you can configure what you want to record, how often,
and you can start and stop recordings.
